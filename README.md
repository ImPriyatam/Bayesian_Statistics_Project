# Bayesian_Statistics_Project
**Parameter estimation** through Bayesian statistics is a powerful and flexible approach used in various fields of science and data analysis to infer the most likely values of unknown parameters in a model. It involves combining prior knowledge (prior distribution) about the parameters with observed data to update our beliefs and obtain a posterior distribution that reflects the updated knowledge about the parameters.
## Parameter Estimation Problem

## Eddington's Parameter Estimation Problem
â€‹The aim of this exercise is to analyse photographic plates from Eddington's 1919 eclipse expedition, to determine whether the data favour Newtonian gravity or Einstein's General Theory of Relativity.
